## Description
This repository contains solutions for Assignment 5, which focuses on the
implementation of Python data structures such as dictionaries and lists,
along with string and slicing operations.

## Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks
### Objective
- To understand the use of dictionaries in Python
- To retrieve values using keys
- To handle cases where the key does not exist

### Functionality
- A dictionary is created with student names as keys and marks as values
- User is prompted to enter a student name
- If the name exists, corresponding marks are displayed
- If the name does not exist, an appropriate message is shown

### File
`Task1_StudentMarks.py`

## Task 2: List Slicing
### Objective
- To understand list creation and slicing
- To reverse elements using slicing techniques

### Functionality
- A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created
- First five elements are extracted using slicing
- The extracted list is reversed
- Both extracted and reversed lists are displayed

### File
`Task2_ListSlicing.py`
