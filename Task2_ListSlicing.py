# Task 2: List slicing and reversing

# Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Extracting first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Reversing the extracted elements
reversed_list = first_five[::-1]

# Printing results
print("Original List:", numbers)
print("First Five Elements:", first_five)
print("Reversed First Five Elements:", reversed_list)
